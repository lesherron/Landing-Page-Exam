# Landing Page Project

## Description

Took a starter code that has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project and used javascript to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. 

## Files Used

Modified the HTML and CSS files, but primarily used the JavaScript file to create interactivity.

Started with the `js/app.js` file to start building out the app's functionality

## Changes
1. Added styling to navigation items so that the item is highlighted according to the chosen section (javascript)
2. Added styling to each section when it is active (javascript)
3. Used javascript and css to hide the navigation bar when the browser is idle
4. Used javascript and css to add a scroll to top button when the viewport is below the first section
5. Added a fourth section
6. Changed design (see Design Changes)


## Design Changes

1. Replaced dummy text with real text for all sections 
2. Added images to each section, keeping responsiveness in mind
3. Added more styling to the <p> elements
