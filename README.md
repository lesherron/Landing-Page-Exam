# Landing Page Project

## Description

Took a starter code that has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project and used javascript to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. 

## Files Used

Modified the HTML and CSS files, but primarily used the JavaScript file to create interactivity.

Started with the `js/app.js` file to start building out the app's functionality

## Loading the Web Page
To get the page running you'll need to start the Node server by typing an npm command in the terminal:
```
npm start
```

To see the web page, you'll need to click the ***VIEW THE WEB PAGE*** button at the bottom of the screen.

That will open a new browser tab that contains the replica web page.  The page will update as you make changes.

## Tips for Using the Workspace

1. Expand the workspace to full screen. That will give you more room to work.
2. If the type in the workspace is too small, use your browser's zoom control to magnify the screen.
3. You can upload files to the workspace by dragging and dropping them into the workspace window.
4. You can download files from the workspace by right-clicking on the file in the ***Explorer*** panel and selecting ***Download***.
